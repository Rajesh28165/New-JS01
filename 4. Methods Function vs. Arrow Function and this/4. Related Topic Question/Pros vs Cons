Arrow Function:

Pros: It lexically binds this to the surrounding context, useful in callbacks or closures.

Cons: Cannot be used as methods because 'this' does not refer to the object. It refers to the outer scope.


Regular Function:

Pros: Correctly binds 'this' to the object when used as methods, making them ideal for object methods.

Cons: 'this' can be lost if the method is passed around as a callback. It may require .bind(this) or an arrow function to preserve 'this'.
